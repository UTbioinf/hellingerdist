hellingerDist measures the hellinger distance between pairs of distributions


Use:
               takes a reference distribution and a matrix in which each row is used as a
               comparison distribution

Syntax:
   [hdists] = hellingerDist(indists, ref, b)

Inputs:
   indists - a matrix; each row is a distribution to be compared to ref^M
   ref                 - an array reference distribution
   b                   - number of bins.
